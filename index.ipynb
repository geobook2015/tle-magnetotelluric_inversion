    "There are 5 notebooks in this tutorial - we wrote them starting from discretizing the governing equations for the Magnetotelluric Problem, running a forward simulation and exploring an example of non-uniqueness, and performing the inversion. Although this is a natural order in terms of building the pieces, you do not need to work through them in order, each notebook is self-contained and has links to others where appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [1_MT1D_NumericalSetup](./1_MT1D_NumericalSetup.ipynb): discretize and solve the 1D MT equations \n",
    "- [2_MT1D_ForwardModellingAndNonuniqueness](./2_MT1D_ForwardModellingAndNonuniqueness.ipynb): run the forward simulation and explore an example of non-uniqueness\n",
    "- [3_MT1D_5layer_inversion](./3_MT1D_5layer_inversion.ipynb): run inversions for a 5 layer model and explore the impacts of choosing a trade-off parameter $\\beta$, and changing the regularization parameters smoothness and smallness ($\\alpha_s$ and $\\alpha_z$). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also 2 \"appendix\" notebooks\n",
    "- [Appendix_A_MT1D_Sensitivity](./Appendix_A_MT1D_Sensitivity.ipynb): derive and test the sensitivity \n",
    "- [Appendix_B_MT1D_tests](./Appendix_B_MT1D_tests.ipynb): demonstrates how we test the code"
